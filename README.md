# Welcome to Baseplate!
Welcome to Baseplate!
## What is Baseplate?
Baseplate is a JS library for doing everything that was never quite there, but was always needed. From sorting through objects to easily importing libraries, Baseplate is your go to place.
## Installation
Installing Baseplate is quite easy! All you have to do is add this line to your code:
\<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/0rbitX/baseplate@1.0.0/index.js"><\/script>
This will import all of Baseplate, along with another tool called Port, which we will get to in a moment. 
> [!TIP]
> To load the most recent version, sub the link above with https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/0rbitX/baseplate@main/index.js
